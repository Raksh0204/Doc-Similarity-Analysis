# 📄 Doc Similarity & Semantic Redundancy Analysis System
---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing document similarity** and **detecting semantic redundancy** between text files.
It helps identify repeated ideas even when they are written using different words or sentence structures.
The system is useful in areas like plagiarism detection, document comparison, and content analysis, where understanding meaning matters more than exact word matches.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce manual effort in document comparison
- Detect similarity beyond exact word matching
- Identify repeated ideas expressed differently
- Improve efficiency and accuracy in document analysis

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📥 Input documents are taken from test_docs/
2. 📂 Reference documents are loaded from reference_docs/
3. 🧠 Text is processed and analyzed for similarity
4. 📊 The system identifies:
    Similar documents
    Repeated ideas written in different forms
