📄 Doc Similarity & Semantic Redundancy Analysis System
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing document similarity and detecting semantic redundancy between text files.
It helps identify repeated ideas even when they are written using different words or sentence structures.

The system is useful in areas like plagiarism detection, document comparison, and content analysis, where understanding meaning matters more than exact word matches.

🎯 Objectives

Reduce manual effort in document comparison
Detect similarity beyond exact word matching
Identify repeated ideas expressed differently
Improve efficiency and accuracy in document analysis

⚙️ How It Works

Input documents are collected from the test_docs folder
Reference documents are loaded from reference_docs
Text is processed and analyzed for similarity
The system identifies:
Similar documents
Repeated ideas written in different forms

💡 Key Features

Semantic-based document comparison
Redundancy detection across multiple files
Simple and modular project structure
Easy to extend for larger datasets
